I am Daniel, currently located in Singapore, and I'm always on the lookout for learning opportunities and experiences to expand my horizons. Trained in Data Science and Analytics, I seek to specialise in the areas of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, whilst still remaining highly interested in the analyst side of things. Regardless of industry or field of study, I am always motivated and passionate to learn as much as I can!
